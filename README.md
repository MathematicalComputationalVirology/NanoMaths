The three files should be read into MATLAB.
Files called "cage_10_analysis_final_with_theta.m", "cage_14_analysis_final_with_theta.m" and "cage_16_analysis_final_with_theta" are for KWOCAs cages:
In each code the range of S is currently specified according to the experimentaly observed range.
The input is the range of theta, and the output is the corresponding range of delta. In the paper (Fig. 4c) we indicate the value of
delta closest to the experimentally observed range.

Files called "trimer_angle_distribution.m", "finding_minimal_arm_length.m", "plotting_k_range.m" and "trimer_distribution_range_check.m" are for I32-10 cages:
plotting_k_range.m finds minimal frequency (mf) for various scaling factors (k) and plots the results.
trimer_angle_distribution.m: The imput is k and the output is the minimum and maximum arm length, and mf.
finding_minimal_arm_length.m finds the ideal arm length range.
trimer_distribution_range_check.m: The input is the minimum and maximum arm lenght and the output are the mf values.
